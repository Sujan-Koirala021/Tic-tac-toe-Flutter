# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe (nep: आलु क्रस)  is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
